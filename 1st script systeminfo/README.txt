This is the very first script i worte to help me become more productive. 
Before now ive mostly studied bash and linux terminal my journey threw windows scripting with bat files is mostly slef taught
ive studied a little bit of everything and in my opinion if you are interested in leanring for the first time any type of code 
i suggest you pay attition mostly to the concepts; there are certian things that are common in most langauges. 
Example learn the difference between: commands, aliases, functions, lists, arrays, loops,
redirecting output, classes, objects, ect, as the majority of these thing are common in most languages. 
In My Opinion knowing the tools avaiable and when to use them and when to use something different take prioreity over 
exact syntax which will come more with experience.

I wanted to find a better way to display the output of the info
so i echo'd everything into an html file and WHALA a html for all
the info. I also wanted to explore aliases and iteration and added 
them to the scripts. Ideas from this is autowebpage.bat
